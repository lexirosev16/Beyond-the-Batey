Together, they revisit her memory of being arrested in 1999 alongside Normal Salazar. As Marien re-enacts the moment, the dancers around her extend and amplify the memory through movement, creating a collective form of choreopolitics.In this shared practice, the group simultaneously embodies protesters and choreopolicing forces. Some dancers channel the rigidity of U.S. military presence, their arms shaped like rifles, while others move with the resistance and urgency of the Vieques demonstrators. The class becomes both the agents of suppression and the agents of defiance, revealing the tension between control and liberation through their bodies.
