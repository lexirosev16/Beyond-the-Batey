00:06:07.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Marien states that even though Africans were ripped from their homelands their histories in Puerto Rico were not erased but added to Puerto Rican culture and music. She explains that they used their consciousness and the drums around them to create community history and resistance. She adds that this energy is felt on a communal level. She also says that bomba is paying tribute to two bomba elders Ramon Allers and Maria Cristy who dedicated their lives to the cultural labor of bomba. Maria Christy is unique in that she composes music, sings, dances, and plays the barril. 

00:10:06.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Ramón "Papo" Allers Ponce is the grandson of a bomba matriarch from Mayaguez known as Asuncion Cavalleri. Later on, Marien gives Ramon an artisan-made maraca as a tribute to his legacy. Ramon directs a bomba school in Mayaguez. Of his grandfather's nephews he was the only one who took up learning bomba. Allers states that culture will never die as long as there is interest in bomba, reflecting a broader theme of music sustainability. This is reflected by the growing numbers of students enrolling in his school in Mayaguez, and the increasing attendees performing at the annual encuentros de los tambores.

Marien Torres explains that seven delegations are participating in the Encuentros de Tambores. These delegations include Cangrejos, Diáspora, Loíza, Este, Oeste, Norte, Sur, and Carolinas. To qualify, each delegation must have at least 25 drummers available to represent its region. Torres emphasizes the significance of the event, noting that it is an annual regional gathering that brings together participants ranging from amateurs to professionals. The encuentros take regions and combine them into zones. Uniting these regions into zones helps different bomba scenes to grow and to work together.

Marien Torres explains that the diaspora is an essential part of bomba. She also notes that the festival’s title is meant to be inclusive of other Afro-Caribbean regions and cultures which is why Norma Salazar chose the name Encuentro de Tambores instead of Encuentro de Barriles. Torres adds that bambula means “to recognize” and her intention is for the festival to continue growing while emphasizing that bomba is rooted in Africa.
