Una tradición nacida de la resistencia, que hoy sigue siendo una celebración de la libertad. Cada pueblo de Puerto Rico expresa la bomba a su manera. Los ritmos laten en la arena, un diálogo improvisado donde el cuerpo ordena y la música obedece. Los ritmos se mezclan con el carnaval y la energía del pueblo. Los vejigantes, mitad enigmáticos, tallados por artesanos y pintados con colores vibrantes, no son disfraces, son espíritus del Caribe. Despiertan la memoria ancestral de nuestro pueblo, son guardianes de la cultura, símbolos de resistencia que encarnan la eterna batalla contra lo oscuro. En cada máscara arde la fuerza de un pueblo que transforma el miedo en poder y la lucha en celebración. El baile de bomba es fuerza, tensión y libertad. La bomba es unión: une a pueblos y a generaciones, orgullo cultural Afro-Boricua. Cuando el ritmo llama, toda la comunidad responde. "

He attended local bomba hubs such as Terraza de Bonanza, a chinchorro in San Juan known for hosting bailes de bomba, along with rumba, salsa, and plena. Rauw has also been taking classes directly from Jesús Cepeda and Mario Cepeda. His dedication to learning how to dance bomba is therefore more authentic and meaningful than the Bad Bunny collaboration, even though the Bad Bunny collaboration had a greater impact in regard to the international reception of bomba and in terms of total economic revenue generated for practitioners.  "

The video also incorporated vejigantes, though in a morbid and unconventional manner that has been analyzed by heavy metal scholars [add citation here]. Despite the innovative blending of genres, the work did not achieve significant impact. While Puya has enjoyed popularity both in Puerto Rico and internationally, and is recognized for its experimentation with local Puerto Rican genres, narratives, and lyrics within the framework of metal and rock, the \"Cultura\" itself was not widely disseminated within the bomba community. In fact, I personally publicized its release through my academic social media account @ethnmusicologypr to raise awareness of its existence. Nevertheless, it represents another example of bomba circulating in new contexts and contributing to the discourse surrounding neo-bomba. Members of the bomba community responded positively to the effort, yet ultimately emphasized the cultural and economic influence of Rauw Alejandro and Bad Bunny, whose collaborations have had far greater resonance in shaping both the reception and the transnational visibility of bomba. "

Its significance lies in the fact that, in 2024, the Delegación del Carolina38 employed the introduction of the song at the Encuentro de Tambores before transitioning into a more traditional bomba style. This moment of paraphrase, or splicing, resembles practices in hip-hop and rap, where short melodic segments or lyrics are interjected into a new song to allude to a shared musical legacy. It is also important because it highlights how commercial collaborations are giving rise to a new subset of the genre, often referred to as neo-bomba, which fuses traditional bomba with commercial music. The bomba interpretation of “De Carolina” differs by shifting into a distinct chorus, yet it demonstrates how the younger generation is innovating within the genre. While this innovation risks losing sight of bomba’s “fundamentals,” it enriches the tradition by infusing youthful creativity. In doing so, it continues to celebrate places and acknowledge humble roots. This moment of musical overlap also shows that bomba practitioners not only collaborate with commercial music partners but also allow these shared spaces and collaborations to shape their own sense of musical experimentation and identity in profound new ways. Beyond this, this song also shows that Rauw Alejandro occupies a more 'authentic' place within the bomba community, than Bad Bunny. Rauw, unlike Bad Bunny, can be found dancing bomba in local spaces, such as [Terranza Bonanza and El Iman]. It's one thing to perform with bomberos, but its another to learn besides bomba elders. "

Whether that be through mentioning gender violence as a preface to the performance of the plena “Cortaron Elena,” or through sewing the throughline of freedom in juxtaposition with oppression through his words. Yet, it was for these reasons, and the inclusion of hip-hop and reggae that the original reception of the film originally faced some backlash. Since, in 2001, PR did not always read hip-hip as connecting closely with la isla due to Afro-diasporic musical marginalization.  "
